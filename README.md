This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Dear Friends,

This app is based on the Udemy course "React Fundamentals" by Mr. Edvinas Daugirdas.

Please note that i have added an extra feature--a back to search link--to the Single Series page.

Also, i have not included the whatwg-fetch library that was demonstrated in the course (as it worked for me in Chrome browser even without it).

Finally, in my final commit (named "Successful Completion of App"), i have retained the name index.js only for the file that is in the SRC folder and named all other index.js files to their respective folder names (e.g., Loader.js for the JS file in the Loader folder).
